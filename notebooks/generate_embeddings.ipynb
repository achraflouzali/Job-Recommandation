Through public programming, we work to inspire scientific curiosity in everyday life. In the Cantor lab (https://morgridge.org/research/labs/cantor/), our guiding hypothesis is that existing model systems have masked critical insights into human cell-environment interactions. We test this through a variety of approaches at the interface of basic biology and engineering â integrating our efforts in tool development with methods in biochemistry, systems biology, functional genomics, and chemical genetics. Our broad goals are to better understand the role of environmental factors in basic human cell physiology and drug sensitivity â with a particular focus on blood cancers and normal immune cells. This position is immediately available for an enthusiastic individual with an interest in the areas described above. The successful candidate will have an opportunity to join our passionate team of trainees who are currently pursuing a diverse suite of multidisciplinary projects. The candidate is expected to play an integral role in establishing a new gene essentiality profiling platform that integrates CRISPR/Cas9-based screening with a novel bioreactor-based platform to identify genetic dependencies in cancer cells growing under controlled conditions that more closely simulate those in the body. In addition, the candidate will also work with Dr. Cantor to identify additional (project) opportunities that support their scientific and professional development. Our team is jointly affiliated with the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Morgridge Institute for Research, where our lab is located. We have additional affiliations with the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, and the Wisconsin Blood Cancer Research Institute.
